                I built this site in order to document all of the art I have created as I have got back into my hobby of drawing.
                Drawing is something I've always enjoyed doing throughout life, but I never really sat down and decided that I wanted to
                improve at it. I would often gain spontaneous bursts of motivation to draw, and constantly go back and forth throughout my
                childhood to phases of drawing and not drawing. And so, during my college years at the height of my stress, I began drawing
                as an outlet to vent my stress, and let my creative side roam free. Now, I find myself in a position where I really want to
                improve my skills, and with this site, I can document my journey of improvement, and also create a nice way of archiving and
                looking back at memories.
