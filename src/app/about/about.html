                My name is Justin, and I am an aspiring artist.<br>Art is not my main job in life, but it is something that I have always
                enjoyed doing. Whether its to destress, or simply to improve my skills, I have always had a fun time whenever I drew. 
                This site is here to be evidence of my art journey, and perhaps eventually promote my art once I feel skilled enough to 
                start doing commissions.
